# **Revisit the case study** 

In this workshop series we are working with a real dataset from a knockout mouse model study by [Corley et al. (2016)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2801-4). This study used the mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a rare genetic disease in people.

WBS affects multiple body systems and has physical, cognitive, and behavioural components. Previous studies of WBS patients with deletions of the 7q11.23 chromosomal region have led to the conclusion that a disruption of *Gtf2ird1* and *Gtf2i* genes explain the features of WBS, including:

* Delays in prenatal and postnatal growth
* Short stature 
* Intellectual disabilities
* Distinctive facial features

[Corley et al. (2016)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2801-4) used lip tissue from a *Gtf2ird1* knockout mouse model to capture phenotypic effects most present in the epidermal tissues. *Gtf2ird1* is located on [chromosome 5 (5qG2) of the mouse genome](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm10&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr5%3A134357669%2D134456716&hgsid=1456220341_mnD8xWDvrPHm8X2fFTJs0p1vMHoU). We [visualised this region](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/rna-seq-pt1-quarto/notebooks/3.4_Alignment_using_STAR.html#alignment-to-reference-genome) of our alignment files using IGV, yesterday.  

### **The study design**

* 6 mice  
    + 3 knockouts (missing exon 1 of *Gtf2ird1*)
    + 3 wildtypes
* Total RNA extracted from epidermal (lip) tissue 
* 101 bp single end reads sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000

### **Research questions** 

- Which genes (if any) are upregulated or downregulated in our knockout mice compared with normal mice? 
- How do these differentially expressed genes relate to the disease phenotype?â€‹
