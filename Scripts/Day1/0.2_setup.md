In this workshop series, we will be using Pawsey’s Nimbus cloud. The [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/about-us/about-pawsey/) is one of two, Tier-1, High Performance Computing facilities in Australia. 

The main requirements for this workshop are a personal computer with:

* A web browser 
* Visual Studio Code (recommended) or a terminal application 

Below, you will find instructions on how to set up a terminal application and web browser on your computer and how to connect to Nimbus. Each participant will be provided with their instance’s IP address at the beginning of the workshop. 

### **Option 1: Install and set up Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight and powerful source code editor available for Windows, macOS and Linux computers. 

1. Download Visual Studio Code for your system from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the instructions for:
    * [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
    * [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
    * [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)
    
2. Open the VS Code application on your computer

#### **Login via Visual Studio Code**

Connect to your instance with VS code by adding the host details to your `.ssh` config file:

  1. Go to the list of instance IP addresses provided in the Slack channel
  2. Find and copy your IP address, it will start with 146.118.XXX.XX 
  3. In a new VS code terminal, type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` if you're on a Windows machine or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` for MacOS to open the command palette 
  4. Select `Select Remote-SSH: Open SSH configuration file` and select your `.ssh` config file
  5. Add a new entry using your allocated IP address and save your `.ssh` config file: 

  ```default
  Host rnaseqWorkshop
    HostName 146.118.XXX.XX
    User training
  ```

  6. Type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` and select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host` and `rnaseqWorkshop` 
  7. When prompted, select `Linux` as the platform of the remote host from the dropdown menu 
  8. Type in your provided password (see the Slack channel for the password) and hit enter 

Having successfully logged in, you should see a small blue or green box in the bottom left corner of your screen:

To set up your VS Code window for the workshop:

1. Open a new folder in the file explorer panel on the left side of the screen by typing `Ctrl` + `K`, `Ctrl` + `O` if you're running Windows or `Cmd`+`K`+ `Cmd` + `O` for MacOS 
2. Select `/home/training` to open your instance's $HOME folder, this is where we will be working
2. When prompted, select the box for `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder ‘home’` then click `Yes, I trust the authors`
3.	To open a terminal, type `Ctrl`+`J` if you're on a Windows machine or `Cmd`+`J` on MacOS

### **Option 2: Install and set up a terminal application**

The terminal applications available to you will depend on your operating system. 

#### **Linux terminals**
If you use Linux, chances are you already know your shell and how to use it. Basically, just open your preferred terminal program and off you go!

#### **OS X (Mac)**

Mac operating systems come with a terminal program, called Terminal. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit `Command + Space` and type 'terminal'. You may find that other, 3rd party terminal programs are more user-friendly and powerful, like [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/).

#### **Windows**

We recommend [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html), which offers a rich experience as a full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for ssh connections, the free version is more than adequate.

To install and start using MobaXterm:

1. Go to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html
2. Under ‘Home Edition’ select the Download now button
3. Select the MobaXterm Home Edition (Installer edition)
4. Once the program is downloaded, install it as you would any other windows program
5. Once the program is installed, start the MobaXterm program
6. From this screen, click on ‘start local terminal’ (and install Cygwin if prompted)

#### **Login via Terminal**

To log in to Nimbus, we will use a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. To connect, you need 3 things:

* The assigned IP address of your instance (i.e. 146.118.XXX.XX). Each participant will be provided with their instance’s IP address at the beginning of the workshop.
* Your login name. In our case, this will be **training** for all participants.
* Your password. All participants will be provided with a password at the beginning of the workshop.

To log in: type the following into your terminal, using your allocated instance’s IP address:

```default
ssh training@146.118.XXX.XX
```

You will receive a message saying:

```default
The authenticity of host '146.118.XX.XXX (146.118.XX.XXX)' can't be established.
```

Remember your host address will be different than the one above. There will then be a message saying:

```default
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

If you would like to skip this message next time you log in, answer ‘yes’. It will then give a warning:

```default
Warning: Permanently added '146.118.XX.XXX' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

Enter the password provided at the beginning of the workshop. Ask one of the demonstrators if you’ve forgotten it.

::: {.callout-note}
## Pay Attention
When you type a password on the terminal, there will not be any indication the password is being entered. You'll not see a moving cursor, or even any asterisks, or bullets. That is an intentional security mechanism used by all terminal applications and can trip us up sometimes, so be careful when typing or copying your password in.  
:::

Having successfully logged in, your terminal should then display something like that shown in the figure below:
