# Materials draft

In this workshop, we are working with a real dataset from a knockout mouse model study by [Corley et al. (2016)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2801-4). This study used the mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a rare genetic disease in people.

[Williams-Beuren Syndrome](https://www.omim.org/entry/194050) affects multiple body systems and has physical, cognitive, and behavioural traits. Previous studies of WBS patients with deletions of the 7q11.23 chromosomal region have led to the conclusion that a disruption of *Gtf2ird1* and *Gtf2i* genes explain the features of WBS, including:

*  Delays in prenatal and postnatal growth
* Short stature
* Intellectual disabilities
* Distinctive facial features

Corley et al. (2016) used lip tissue from a *Gtf2ird1* knockout mouse model to capture phenotypic effects most present in the epidermal tissues. *Gtf2ird1* is located on chromosome 5 (5qG2) of the mouse genome. 

## The study design

* 6 mice
    * 3 knockouts (missing exon 1 of *Gtf2ird1*)
    * 3 wildtypes
* mRNA extracted from epidermal (lip) tissue
* 101 bp paired-end reads sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000

## Research questions 

* Which genes (if any) are upregulated or downregulated in our knockout mice compared with normal mice?
* How do these differentially expressed genes relate to the disease phenotype?â€‹

## Reflection exercise

Considering the KO mouse model used in this experiment and the phenotypes associated with WBS, please answer the following questions. 

### Poll questions 

Q1: Which sorts of genes do you expect will be up/downregulated in KO compared with WT?
* A: Compensatory mechanisms countering the effect of the KO. Downregulation of genes regulated by Gtf2ird1 

Q2: How might gene expression correlate with known features of WBS? 
* A: Genes associated with distinctive facial features, cognitive function and neural development, growth and development. 

Q3: Can you identify a potential limiting factor in the experimental design which might affect result interpretation?
* A: Small sample size lacking statistical power. Lip epidermal tissue fails to represent changes in other tissue types (neuro). KO of single exon might retain partial functionality.
