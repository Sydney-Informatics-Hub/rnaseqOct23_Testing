# **Workshop timetable and learning objective**

In this workshop, we explore RNAseq data preprocessing and analyses for differential expression experiments. Our goal for this workshop is to provide you with foundational knowledge required to understand the basic RNAseq workflow and responsibly apply these methods to your own research.

These sessions will provide you with an opportunity to develop your skills and get exposure to key concepts of RNAseq, practice running nf-core workflows, and performing downstream analyses in RStudio. We have outlined the timetable and learning objectives for each session below:
